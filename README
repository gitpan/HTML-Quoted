NAME
    HTML::Quoted - extract structure of quoted HTML mail message

SYNOPSIS
        use HTML::Quoted;
        my $html = '...';
        my $struct = HTML::Quoted->extract( $html );

DESCRIPTION
    Parses and extracts quotation structure out of a HTML message. Purpose
    and returned structures are very similar to Text::Quoted.

SUPPORTED FORMATS
    Variouse MUAs use quite different approaches for quoting in mails.

    Some use *blockquote* tag and it's quite easy to parse.

    Some wrap text into *p* tags and add '>' in the beginning of the
    paragraphs.

    Things gettign messier when it's an HTML reply on plain text mail
    thread.

    If you found format that is not supported then file a bug report via
    rt.cpan.org with as short as possible example. Test file is even better.
    Test file with patch is the best. Not obviouse patches without tests
    suck.

METHODS
  extract
        my $struct = HTML::Quoted->extract( $html );

    Takes a string with HTML and returns array reference. Each element in
    the array either array or hash. For example:

        [
            { 'raw' => 'Hi,' },
            { 'raw' => '<div><br><div>On date X wrote:<br>' },
            [
                 { 'raw' => '<blockquote>' },
                 { 'raw' => 'Hello,' },
                 { 'raw' => '<div>How are you?</div>' },
                 { 'raw' => '</blockquote>' }
            ],
            ...
        ]

    Hashes represent a part of the html. The following keys are meaningful
    at the moment:

    *   raw - raw HTML

    *   quoter_raw, quoter - raw and decoded (entities are converted) quoter
        if block is prefixed with quoting characters

  combine_hunks
      my $html = HTML::Quoted->combine_hunks( $arrayref_of_hunks );

    Takes the output of "extract" and turns it back into HTML.
